- Analyze relationships between economic, social, and health factors.
- Provide open-source documentation and code for community use and contribution.

## Projects Contents
- **Data**: Sourced from [specific source, e.g., World Bank, WHO] (please update with the actual source).
- **Tools**: R, Python, Git, GitHub.
- **Key Files**:
  - `R/04_visualization.R`: R script for data visualization.
  - [Add other files if applicable, e.g., `data/cleaned_data.csv`].
